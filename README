CSV structure:
CSV structure presents a transposed table. The table is turned to the left. (Titles are on the left and not on top). This makes it easier to keep track of CSV content.
Each row presents one Word Group.
The first word in each row is the title and is not included in the calculation. All other words in the line are synonyms or subsets of the title.
Example:
dm, dialog management, dialouge management, conversational agent, chatbot, embodied conversational agent, embodied agent
